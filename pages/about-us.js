            <strong>The Ss. Nicodemus & Joseph Orthodox Christian Burial Society of Northern Colorado</strong> was established in 2013 to assist those desiring to follow Ancient Orthodox Christian Practices in pre-planning their burial or that of a loved one. It is a Pan-Orthodox society made up of Orthodox volunteers from Northern Colorado who view the societyâ€™s work as a ministry to the grieving and a service to departed Christian brothers and sisters in preparing them to attend the heavenly banquet with Christ their King and Savior.
